This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) code of
conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report
unacceptable behavior to
[code-of-conduct@stacklok.dev](mailto:code-of-conduct@stacklok.dev).

## Reporting security vulnerabilities

## How to contribute

### Using GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements. If you have a general usage
question, please ask in
[ToolHive's discussion forum](https://discord.gg/stacklok).

If you are reporting a bug, please help to speed up problem diagnosis by
providing as much information as possible. Ideally, that would include a small
sample project that reproduces the problem.

### Not sure how to start contributing?

PRs to resolve existing issues are greatly appreciated, and issues labeled as
["good first issue"](https://github.com/liamstorkey-elmo/toolhive-studio/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
are a great place to start!

### Pull request process

- -All commits must include a Signed-off-by trailer at the end of each commit
  message to indicate that the contributor agrees to the Developer Certificate
  of Origin. For additional details, check out the [DCO instructions](./DCO.md).
- Create an issue outlining the fix or feature.
- Fork the ToolHive repository to your own GitHub account and clone it
  locally.
- Hack on your changes.
- Correctly format your commit messages, see
  [Commit message guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines) below.
- Open a PR with a title that follows the conventional commit format (e.g.,
  `feat: add new feature` or `fix: resolve issue`). The PR title will be
  validated to ensure it follows the conventional commit specification. Ensure
  the description reflects the content of the PR.
- Ensure that CI passes, if it fails, fix the failures.
- Every pull request requires a review from the core ToolHive team before
  merging.
- Once approved, all of your commits will be squashed into a single commit with
  your PR title.
